ibus-xkb
It is XKB for IBus


Build and install from source
=============================

To work with gnome-shell 3.4 or later, the latest ibus 1.4.99 is required.

You need to enable gobject-introspection in the latest ibus and
disable engine and UI so that ibus-xkb's ones are used instead.
If you use dconf, the following patch is required for ibus:
https://github.com/ibus/ibus/commit/4bee2863e8d2e51b185b6d149e6259848d8c0cb6

ibus would be built with the following configure options:

# cd ibus-1.4.99.20120529
# ./configure --prefix=/usr \
              --disable-engine --disable-ui --prefix=/usr \
              --enable-dconf --disable-gconf \
              --enable-introspection

ibus-xkb would be built with the following configure options:

# cd ibus-xkb
# ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-dconf --disable-gconf
